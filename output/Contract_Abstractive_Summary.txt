**Comprehensive Summary:**

This Consulting Agreement, effective February 1, 2020, between Coral Gold Resources Ltd. (the Company) and Intermark Capital Corp. (the Consultant), engages the Consultant to provide executive management and financial consulting services, including serving as President and CEO, through January 31, 2025. The Consultant’s obligations include delivering management and financial advisory services, aligning management initiatives with the Board’s strategic objectives, supervising staff, overseeing compliance, managing investor relations, and fostering organizational culture. The Consultant must devote sufficient time, skill, and loyalty to the role, including significant business travel.

The Company agrees to pay the Consultant a monthly fee of CAD $10,000 plus reasonable expenses and applicable taxes, subject to potential increments by the Compensation Committee. The term is five years, with termination rights allowing either party to end the agreement upon three months’ written notice. Early termination by the Company triggers a termination payment equal to one year’s consulting fees (CAD $120,000). Additionally, the Consultant may terminate within six months following a Change of Control event—defined as acquisition of 20% or more voting power with board control or sale/merger of substantially all assets—and receive a termination payment of CAD $750,000.

The agreement includes strict confidentiality obligations covering a broad scope of financial, technical, business, and proprietary information, which the Consultant must protect during and after the term. The Consultant must return all confidential materials upon termination and exercise reasonable care to prevent unauthorized disclosure. The Consultant is prohibited from soliciting or hiring the Company’s employees during the term and for one year thereafter.

All intellectual property and work products created by the Consultant during the engagement are the exclusive property of the Company. The Consultant must assist in securing IP rights and maintain records accordingly. The Consultant acts as an independent contractor, solely responsible for all taxes related to fees paid and indemnifies the Company against any related claims. The Company may seek equitable remedies, including injunctions, to prevent breaches without needing to prove actual damages.

The agreement limits liability for consequential damages and includes mutual indemnification provisions for losses arising from negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or breach. It is governed by the laws of British Columbia, Canada, with disputes subject to BC courts. Notices must be in writing and delivered by specified methods, with waivers only effective if written and signed. The agreement contains standard provisions on severability, assignment restrictions, survival of key clauses, and interpretation rules emphasizing time sensitivity and Canadian dollar currency.
