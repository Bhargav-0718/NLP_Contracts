**Comprehensive Summary of the Pizza Fusion Franchise Agreement**

This Franchise Agreement between Pizza Fusion Holding, Inc. (and related entities) and the Franchisee governs the operation of a single Pizza Fusion restaurant under a proprietary system emphasizing organic, all-natural products and environmentally friendly practices. The franchise term is initially 10 years, with options to renew for two additional 10-year terms, subject to strict compliance with operational, financial, and maintenance obligations.

**Key Franchisee Obligations:**

- **Site and Premises:** Franchisee must select, acquire, and obtain franchisor approval for the restaurant site within 90 days of the agreement date, lease or purchase the premises within 120 days, and open the restaurant within nine months (default) or as otherwise specified. Franchisee must construct and equip the premises strictly per franchisor-approved plans, comply with all laws, maintain the premises in excellent condition, and refurbish at least once every five years.

- **Use of Proprietary Marks and System:** Franchisee receives a limited, non-ownership license to use Pizza Fusion’s trademarks and proprietary system only at the approved location, strictly following franchisor standards. Franchisee must not sublicense, transfer, or use marks outside authorized parameters and must cease all use upon termination or expiration.

- **Operational Standards and Training:** Franchisee must maintain high quality, appearance, and service standards, employ certified managers including an Operating Principal who must personally supervise the business full-time, and complete franchisor-mandated initial and ongoing training programs. Failure to complete training or maintain certifications can lead to termination.

- **Payments and Fees:** Franchisee pays a non-refundable initial franchise fee of $30,000, ongoing royalties of 6% of gross revenues (paid weekly), and contributes 3% of gross revenues to a centralized Marketing Fund plus up to 4% to Regional Funds if applicable. Franchisee must also spend at least 3% of gross sales quarterly on local marketing. Late payments incur escalating fees and interest at 1.5% per month.

- **Reporting and Audits:** Franchisee must maintain accurate business records for at least seven years, submit monthly and annual financial reports, and provide quarterly customer lists. The franchisor may audit records with 10 days’ notice; underreporting gross revenues by 2% or more on three occasions within 12 months or 5% or more over any four consecutive weeks can trigger immediate termination and penalties.

- **Territorial and Sales Restrictions:** Franchisee may operate only at the approved premises and sell only to retail customers on-site and within a defined delivery/catering and advertising area. No wholesale, online, or sublicensed sales are permitted without franchisor consent. Advertising and solicitation are restricted to approved geographic areas, with prior approval required for any advertising reaching beyond.

- **Sourcing and Products:** Franchisee must purchase all food, equipment, supplies, and proprietary Secret Recipe Products exclusively from franchisor-approved suppliers and comply with franchisor specifications. Use
