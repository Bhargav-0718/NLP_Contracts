# üìú NLP Contract Summarization & Risk-Sensitive Clause Revision

This project explores **NLP-based approaches** for **contract summarization** and **risk-sensitive clause review**, leveraging transformer-based models to help lawyers and organizations efficiently review complex contracts.

---

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Contracts contain **thousands of clauses** with varying risk levels. Manual review is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to:

* Extract **key obligations, risks, and liabilities** from contracts.
* Generate **summaries** for faster contract understanding.
* Flag and suggest **revisions** for risky clauses.
* **Tier clauses by criticality** to guide legal expert review.

---

## üìö Literature Review

We studied several datasets and benchmarks for legal NLP tasks:

* **CUAD (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset)** ‚Üí Clause-span extraction with ~13K expert annotations.
* **MAUD (Merger Agreement Understanding Dataset)** ‚Üí Question-answering on merger agreements.
* **LexGLUE / LEDGAR** ‚Üí Large-scale provision classification from SEC filings.
* **LegalBench** ‚Üí Benchmark for legal reasoning tasks.
* **ACORD** ‚Üí Clause retrieval dataset for drafting workflows.
* **Other works** explored party-specific summarization, abstractive summarization of obligations, and smart contract summarization.

## üìÇ Dataset

We primarily used **CUAD**, consisting of:

* **510 commercial contracts**.
* **13K expert-annotated clauses** across **41 clause types** (e.g., *Termination, Liability, Indemnification*).
* Preprocessed into a **2-column dataset**: `[clause, label]`.
* Labels mapped to **5 Tiers** for risk-prioritization in legal review.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing

* **PDF/DOCX extraction** using `pdfplumber` and `python-docx`.
* **Segmentation** into clauses/paragraphs.
* **Cleaning**: removal of headers/footers, whitespace normalization.
* **Clause Classification**: map clause text ‚Üí contract clause type ‚Üí numeric label ‚Üí Tier.

---

## üß† Model Architecture

* **Base Model**: [Legal-BERT](https://huggingface.co/nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased).
* **Clause Classification**: maps clause text ‚Üí clause label ‚Üí Tier.
* **Summarization**: abstractive models (BART/PEGASUS fine-tuned) for generating contract summaries.
* **Risk-Sensitive Revision**: generative LLM prompts to suggest safer clause rewrites.

## üî¢ Tier System for Clauses

Clauses are grouped into **5 Tiers** based on **criticality**:

| Tier                   | Labels / Clauses (CUAD)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Notes                                                                          |

**Explanation:**

* **Tier 1** ‚Üí High-priority clauses that **require legal expert review**.
* **Tier 2** ‚Üí Important clauses, usually reviewed but lower risk than Tier 1.
* **Tier 3** ‚Üí Moderate risk, standard clauses.
* **Tier 4** ‚Üí Low-risk clauses; procedural or informative.
* **Tier 5** ‚Üí Trivial clauses; may be skipped in automated review (e.g., names, dates, document info).
